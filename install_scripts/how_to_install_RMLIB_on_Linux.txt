# Look in the RMLIB distribution in the Linux subfolder for the file "RMLIB".

# This file is an archive, like a ".zip" or a ".tgz" file, but the format is for the very old "cpio" command.

# Don't use the shell scripts that come with the RMLIB.

# Instead, use the "cpio" command to unpack the archive in a folder somewhere, e.g. /usr/lib/RMLIB.11.22.33.

# The CPIO command will make a subfolder called "RMLIB", and under that will be various subfolders, like bin, lib, include.

# Make a symbolic link to the RMLIB subfolder, the one that contains bin, lib, include, calling the symbolic link /usr/lib/RMLIB.

# where you see "RMLIB_Linux_distribution_file", put the full path to the "RMLIB" cpio archive.
