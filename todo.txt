Don't write 2nd "detail" csv for a rollup with only one instance such as all=all - maybe put by-instance csvs in a subfolder, maybe "by_instance".

Edit rollup - allow complete omission of rollup name-instance string.  (and confirm null string works as all=all).

Add configuration data for CLPRs to ivy_cmddev.

DONE add looping over lists of workload parameters in go()

DONE add DFC=IOPS_staircase

add cooldown_by_sidefile.

DONE - add Rollup Total IOPS Setting column.

DONE - enable warmup_seconds to be set to zero.

DONE- update ivy_cmddev to send IOPS rather than I/O count.
	- add timestamp to saved counter value from last time.
	- compute rate and send that.
	- remove the post-processing from ivy to compute the rates - clean ivy and put all the mechanisms in ivy_cmddev.

- Update create workload to be like edit workload where a list of workloadIDs is passed
  to ivyslave, rather than one interlock per workloadid like in original ivyslave.

- switch from CodeBlocks build to cmake or autotools.

DONE (marked deprecated in doc, and when used, prominently shows message to user) - remove "set iosequencer template"

DONE - with a command device, check at end of test step if there is a failed component, and abort and fail the test step if so.

- restore -t tracing

- fix bug where declaring a string variable in a for loop body.

- switch from "fork" to std::thread for ivymaster subthreads to use platform-independent code (position for Windows port)

- go back and do the "measure" +/- math for each individual I/O being a sample for service time.

- in LDEV config data, the path type for a (the default) host group shows type iSCSI instead of Fibre Channel.

- integrate the old catscan SVP configuration file collector into ivy.  Integrate SVP config file attributes into ivy RAID_subsystem object.

- look at flex/bison parser, JSON format for edit_rollup() and for go parameters.

// maybe we have a measure_focus_rollup and a pid_focus_rollup and they default to focus_rollup?
// How hard would it be to have measure and pid each on their own focus_rollup?

- Write .xls output instead of .csv output so that the formula ="xxx" can be removed.

- test using LVM and impact LUN discovery / SCSI Inquiry
- test with multipath software (HDLM / MPIO)

DONE/FIXED - validate with "top" to see if linux CPU is being reported correctly

- in Excel ivy csv file loader spreadsheet - make column titles frozen when you scroll down in long csv files.

CLOSED - Fix DF port numbers to be 0A, 1A, not 1A 2A. - update:  This is a bug in the subsystem - the ports reported by SCSI inquiry are 1A, 2A.

-  for pid, look at if it would help to mark any subinterval where IOPS was at min_IOPS
   as invalid, like if WP were out of range for measure=on.

- have executing a statement set the current source file line number, so that error messages could print it;

- look at making "collapse" which would move all files up out of subfolders and delete the subfolders.
  Or - ivyscript option to not use subfolders ...

- run ivymaster as a GUI application, and show some sort of visual representation subinterval by subinteral.
  Maybe you could offer a tree on the left that shows rollups that you pick from.
  You could pick things you wanted to monitor, and arrange them on the display area.

DONE/FIXED- examine whether to remove the timestamps from the metric_value object and
  perhaps have ivy_cmddev provide data with individual I/O timestamps instead ...

CLOSED - need to be root to access raw LUNs - make ivy run other than as root.

- test [EditRollup] with IOPS increments  / multipliers

- catch a "kill" signal and shut down subtasks gently

Gather config report from SVP and import into ivy subsystem object. (adapt PERL collector).


New iogenerator / DynamicFeedbackController that runs some random offset patterns to discover the underlying characteristics of the subsystem.
- Find cache size automatically. Contrast with physically installed storage capacity from config data.
- Find cache segment size, slot size, and size of LRU queue in slots.
- Find size of WP by blocksize to find segment size, slot size, size of WP slot queue
- Measure seek time by seek LBA distance at sampled points across the LUN - plot zone table accordingly.
- Measure sustained sequential throughput across the drive to plot zone table.
- Measure drive cache buffer size
- Show IOPS by host HBA or PCI bus.
- For SSDs, come up with some way to characterise how their responsiveness varies according to recent history.

Write a tool that detects if there are other non-ivy application or system processes running that are consuming resources and thus impacting ivy's ability to be responsive.
