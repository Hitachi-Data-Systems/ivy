Subject:	Eclipse issue: Indexer not recognizing C++14 language standard

Hi Ian,

I’ve finally managed to identify and fix the problem with Eclipse not recognizing the C++14 language 
standard. (In fact, it was set not to even recognize C++11.)

Here’s how to fix it:

1.	In “Project Explorer” click on the project (ivy).
2.	In the ribbon on the top, select “Project.”
3.	Select “Properties.”
4.	Select “C/C++ General.”
5.	Select “Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros, etc.” (You will probably only be able to read the 
first part of this.)
6.	On the right hand side, you can choose from tabs marked, “Entries” or “Providers.”  Select 
“Entries.”
7.	Below that, select “GNU C++.”
8.	To the right, under “Setting Entries,” select “CDT User Setting Entries.”
9.	Click on the “Add” button.
10.	In the upper left hand, there is a drop-down menu that currently says, “Include Directory.” 
Select the menu and choose the “#Preprocessor Macro” entry.
11.	In the “Name” field, type in “__cplusplus”. (Note that it starts with two ‘_’ underscores.)
12.	In the “Value” field, type in “201402L”. (That’s the correct value for C++14.)
13.	Select the “Treat as built-in” button.
14.	Click on “OK.”
15.	On the lower right of the menu, select “Apply and Close.”
16.	You must re-index the project before this will take effect. Either restart Eclipse or:
a.	Select “Project.”
b.	Select “C/C++ Index.”
c.	Select “Rebuild.”
